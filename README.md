## TTGO Feature


When you do some ESP32projects you must hate to add a power bank to provide the power. This tiny board could solve such problems. A LG 3000mAH 18650 battery could make ESP32run 17 hours or more.

 - 18650 charging system integrated. indicate LED inside(Green means
 - full& Red means charging) Charging and working could be at the same time. 
 - 1 Switch could control the power. 
 - 1 extra LED could be programmed(Connected with GPIO16[D0])
 - 0.5A charging current 1A output Over charge protection Over discharge protection Full ESP32 pins break out
